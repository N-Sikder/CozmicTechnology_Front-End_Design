        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect</h2>
        <p>
          Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website
          background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in
          a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth
          and creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based
          on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are
          close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant
          objects as if they were moving more slowly. The illusion has been long
          adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic
          effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as
          early as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games
          such as Super Mario. With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax
          effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it
          today. <br />
          <br />
          Parallax scrolling holds visitors' attention, providing a visually
          exciting user experience and giving them a heightened sense of control
          as they move through a website. Through a bit of design trickery, it
          turns two-dimensional screen space into something that has depth.
          Curious about how parallax scrolling websites work, and the variety of
          forms they can take? We're going to cover all you need to know, as
          well as offer some hints on how to easily achieve this effect with the
          help of our no-code web creation platform.<br />
          <br />
          Parallax scrolling websites play with space and depth, yet technically
          speaking this design technique is actually a lot simpler than it may
          seem. Most parallax scrolling websites simply move content in the
          foreground at a faster rate than content in the background. Through
          this juxtaposition of movement, parallax scrolling websites create the
          illusion of three-dimensional space. <br />
          <br />
          Parallax scrolling can really enhance the overall user experience of a
          website, livening up a design with motion and enhancing its
          interactivity. When people see that scrolling doesn't move everything
          in one fixed block, but rather touches multiple elements, they feel
          more in control over how they experience a website. This makes it an
          ideal technique for visual storytelling content, giving visitors a
          sense of autonomy in revealing content at their own pace.
